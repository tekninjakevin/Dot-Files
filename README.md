## More about Ricing


================================================================================
## What The Heck are Dot files
 > Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like
 > my shell, ~/.zshrc, our editor in ~/.vimrc, and many others. They are called
 > "dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading . Making them hidden
 > files on your system, although this is not a strict requirement.
 > Since these files are all plain text, we can gather them together in a git
 > repository and use that to track the changes you make over time.

## What is a rice.
 -- From [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/intro-to-dotfiles).

 > "Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements
 > and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of
 > customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they
 > actually were - which was also known as "ricing". Here on /r/unixporn, the
 > word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to
 > refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.
